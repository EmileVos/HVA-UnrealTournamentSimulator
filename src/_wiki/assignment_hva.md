##Overview
The Unreal Tournament Simulator (from now UTS) is the best Unreal Tournament experience, without having to raise a finger yourself.

##Goal
Develop a console-based application where to teams: Red and Blue in 2 to 3 rounds have to fight each other. 

##Requirements
**WARNING** The level is a theoretical concept, players play in a level but do not have to physically move. Imagine that all players are in lines and rows and alternately attacks the other team with weapons. You also may create a visual game, whatever you want!
 * A team has a maximum of 16 players
 * Players have a name, health(HP) and Armour (Level)
 * All weapons are one of the following type:
    * Single-handed
    * Two-handed
    * Melee
 * Players can only carry one weapon of each type
 * Players who died drop the last used weapon
 * Players can pickup weapons, weapons drop by dead players or spawn in the arena/ map
 * A weapon can only be in one player's inventory
 * Weapons have at least a damage level
 * A level also has power-ups which give the player a temporary boost in for example HP or armor
 * After a power-up has been picked up by a player, then the power-up will respawn after a specific amount of time
 * Teams use alternately a player from their own team to attack a player from the other team with weapons. 1 action counts as 1 turn! this also explains gd for something like weapons
 * A player can only die once every round
 * The first team that wins 2 round wins
 
##Assignment
These requirements are the base line of your application, you may in principle change the requirements. You may make it as simple or complicated as you would like, but make sure that you create your base before you move on the create it more complicated. 

##Procedure/ plan
1. Think of your idea and discuss this with your teacher. And discuss all the things you want to learn
2. Create your own code base with your idea.
3. Show your progress
